# House Price Prediction using Advanced Regression Techniques

This notebook is based on a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview). 

The analysis includes extensive EDA and several treatments applied for missing values in the dataset. 

A Linear Regression model is built. It is compared against models built using plain old RFE, and then with models built using Ridge and Lasso regression techniques. 

I also played around with the model parameters (such as doubling the value of alpha) and also trying out the model with some features removed.
